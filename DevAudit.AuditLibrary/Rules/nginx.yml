        summary: |
            The version of Nginx and the name of the operating system can be seen on every server response.
            This information can be used by potential attackers to craft attacks tailored for the particular Nginx version and OS that is running.
            You should always try to avoid disclosing information like this that will be exploited by attackers.     
        resolution: |
            Add server_tokens=off to the http context of your configuration.

        summary: |
            The default Nginx error pages for HTTP 4xx and other errors expose the version of Nginx running.
            This information can be used by potential attackers to craft attacks tailored for the particular Nginx version and/or OS that is running.
            You should always try to avoid disclosing information like this that will be exploited by attackers.         
        resolution: |
            Add a directive like: 
            error_page 401 403 404 /404.html;
            to every server context of the http context of your configuration file. Create the 404.html page that displays the minimal information
            to alert users of the error.

        severity: 1
        xpathtest: boolean(/Nginx/http/server[not(ssl)])
        summary: |
            Information sent over unencrypted connections can be snooped on by potential attackers at any network location between your web server and users. 
            SSL provides encryption between your websites and a user's browser that makes it difficult for attackers to eavesdrop on your users.
            You should alwys try to enable SSL on all your servers to protect your user data. 
        resolution: |
            Configuring SSL requires multiple steps. An example SSL configuration would be like the following added to a server context in your configuration file:
            listen 443;
            ssl on;
            ssl_certificate /usr/local/nginx/conf/server.crt;
            ssl_certificate_key /usr/local/nginx/conf/server.key;
            access_log /usr/local/nginx/logs/ssl.access.log;
            error_log /usr/local/nginx/logs/ssl.error.log;
