        summary: |
            By default you can ssh to the server as root. It is best not to allow root to login directly to the server. 
            Instead, you should login to the system as your account and then do ‘su -‘ to login as root.

        summary: |
            By default anybody who is authenticated successfully are allowed to login. 
            Instead you can restrict which users (or groups) you allow to login to the system.
