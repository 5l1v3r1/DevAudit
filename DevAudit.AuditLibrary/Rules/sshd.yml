        title: Root login is permitted
        xpathtest: not(/SSHD/Values/PermitRootLogin='no')
        summary: |
            By default you can ssh to the server as root. It is best not to allow root to login directly to the server. 
            Instead, you should login to the system as your account and then do ‘su -‘ to login as root.
        resolution: |
            Set PermitRootLogin='yes' in configuration file.

        title:  Do not allow Only Specific Users or Groups (AllowUsers AllowGroups)
        xpathtest: not(boolean(/SSHD/Values/AllowUsers)) and not(boolean(/SSHD/Values/AllowGroups))
        summary: |
            By default anybody who is authenticated successfully are allowed to login. 
            Instead you can restrict which users (or groups) you allow to login to the system.
        resolution: |
            Add directives like the following to configuration file: AllowUsers ramesh john jason and AllowGroups remote_workers.
