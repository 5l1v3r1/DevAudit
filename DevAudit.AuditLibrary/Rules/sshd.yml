        summary: |
            By default you can ssh to the server as root. It is best not to allow root to login directly to the server over SSH. 
            Instead, you should login to the system with your regular account and then do ‘su -‘ to login as root.
        resolution: |
            Add the directive PermitRootLogin='no' to the configuration file.

        summary: |
            You need to explicitly disallow remote login from accounts with empty passwords, update sshd_config with the following line. 
        resolution: |
            Add the directive PermitEmptyPasswords='no' to the configuration file.

        summary: |
            By default anyone who is authenticated successfully is allowed to login. 
            Instead you can restrict which users (or groups) you allow to login to the system.
        resolution: |
            Add directives like the following to configuration file: AllowUsers john jason and AllowGroups remote_workers.

        summary: |
            SSH can emulate the behavior of the obsolete rsh command. You should always disable insecure access via RSH.
        resolution: |
            Add IgnoreRhosts=yes directive to configuration file.

        summary: |
            By default SSH listens to all available interfaces and IP addresses on the system. 
            It is more secure to limit the interfaces and addresses SSH listens on to those you explicitly specify in the configuration file
        resolution: |
            Add a directive like ListenAddress 192.168.2.105 to listen only to that specific address.

        summary: |
            SSH protocol version 1 (SSH-1) has man-in-the-middle attacks problems and security vulnerabilities. 
            SSH-1 is obsolete and should be avoided at all cost.
        resolution: |
            Add Protocol=2 directive to configuration file.

        xpathtest:  /SSHD/Values/Port='22' 
        summary: |
            By default ssh runs on port 22. Most attackers will check if a server is open on port 22, 
            and will randomly use brute force to login to the server using several username and password combination.
            If you change the port # to something different, others need to know exactly what port to use to login to the server using ssh.  
        resolution: |
            Add directives like the following to configuration file: Port 773. This will result in ssh listening on port 773.

        summary: |
            SSH clients should be disconnected after a period of user inactivity.
        resolution: |
            To disconnect a client after 10 minutes (600 seconds) of inactivity add the following directives to the configuration file:
            ClientAliveInterval 600
            ClientAliveCountMax 0

            SSH clients with insecure permissions on known SSH configuration files like ~/.ssh/known_hosts and private key files in ~/.ssh
            are still allowed to connect. 
        resolution: |
            Add the directive StrictModes=yes to the configuration file.

            Password authentication is less secure than public key authentication and can be brute-forced much more easily.

            Add the directive PasswordAuthentication=no to the configuration file.
