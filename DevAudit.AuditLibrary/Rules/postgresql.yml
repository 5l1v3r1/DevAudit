        summary: |
            By default postgres runs on port 5432. Most attackers will check if a server is listening on port 5432.
            If you change the port # to something different, others need to know exactly what port to use to access the server.  
        resolution: |
            Add a directive like the following to the PGSQL configuration file: port 9122.

        summary: |
            Information system auditing capability is critical for accurate forensic analysis. 
            Without information about the outcome of events, security personnel cannot make an accurate assessment as to whether an attack was successful or if changes were made to the security state of the system.
            Event outcomes can include indicators of event success or failure and event-specific results (e.g., the security state of the information system after the event occurred). 
            As such, they also provide a means to measure the impact of an event and help authorized personnel to determine the appropriate response.
        resolution: |
            You must install and configure the pgaudit extension.

        summary: |
            If audit data were to become compromised, then competent forensic analysis and discovery of the true source of
            potentially malicious system activity is impossible to achieve.
            To ensure the veracity of audit data the information system and/or the application must protect audit information from unauthorized modification.
            This requirement can be achieved through multiple methods that will depend upon system architecture and design. Some commonly employed methods
            include ensuring log files enjoy the proper file system permissions and limiting log data locations.
        resolution: |
            Set the log_file_mode directive in the PGSQL configuration file to 0600.

        summary: |
            Any PostgreSQL or associated application providing too much information in error messages on the screen or printout risks compromising the data and security of the system. 
            The structure and content of error messages need to be carefully considered by the organization and development team.
        resolution: |
            Set the client_min_messages directive in the PGSQL configuration file to error.

        summary: |
            If PostgreSQL provides too much information in error logs and administrative messages to the screen, this could lead to compromise. 
            The structure and content of error messages need to be carefully considered by the organization and development team. 
            The extent to which the information system is able to identify and handle error conditions is guided by organizational policy and operational requirements.        
        resolution: |
            Set the client_min_messages directive in the PGSQL configuration file to error.

        summary: |
            Database management includes the ability to control the number of users and user sessions utilizing PostgreSQL. Unlimited
            concurrent connections to PostgreSQL could allow a successful Denial of Service (DoS) attack by exhausting connection resources; and a system can
            also fail or be degraded by an overload of legitimate users. Limiting the number of concurrent sessions per user is helpful in reducing these risks.
        resolution: |
            Set the max_connections directive in the PGSQL configuration file to an organization approved value.

            a modern continuation of Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), or local time with an offset from UTC.        
        resolution: |
            Set the log_timezone directive in the PGSQL configuration file to the current timezone.

        summary: |
            Security flaws with software applications, including database management systems, are discovered daily. 
            Vendors are constantly updating and patching their products to address newly discovered security vulnerabilities. 
            Organizations (including any contractor to the organization) are required to promptly install security-relevant software updates (e.g., patches, service packs, and hot fixes). 
            Flaws discovered during security assessments, continuous monitoring, incident response activities, or information system error handling must also be addressed expeditiously.  
        resolution: |
            Install the most recent (9.6) version of PostgreSQL available for your operating system or distrbution.
