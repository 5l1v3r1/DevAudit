        title: ASP.NET version headers are enabled
        xpathtest: not(boolean(/configuration/system.web/httpRuntime[@enableVersionHeader='false']))
        summary: |
           By default the name and versions of the application frameworks an ASP.NET application uses are sent as response headers, like X-AspNetMvc-Version. 
           For maximum safety it is recommended that these headers not be enabled.
        resolution: |
            Add the attribute enableVersionHeader=false to the httpRuntime element of the system.web section of the ASP.NET Web.config.
