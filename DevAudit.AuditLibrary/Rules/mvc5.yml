        summary: |
           By default the name and versions of the application frameworks an ASP.NET application uses are sent as response headers, like X-AspNetMvc-Version. 
           To avoid disclosing information that can be used by attackers it is recommended that these headers not be enabled.
        resolution: |
            Add the attribute enableVersionHeader=false to the httpRuntime element of the system.web section of the ASP.NET Web.config file.

        summary: |
           By default internal implementation information like control and data flow and variable handling and physical location of code files 
           is disclosed by ASP.NET to visitors when a runtime error is encountered and the default error handling page is used.
           This information should bever be disclosed in an application that is deployed as it will be exploited by attackers,
        resolution: |
            Add the customErrors element with the attribute Mode=On to the system.web section of the ASP.NET Web.config file.

        summary: |
           The ASP.NET application is compiled and run in debug mode. In a deployed application this can lead to information disclosure and vulnerabiliites due
           to settings and code used by developers being enabled in production.
           For maximum safety it is recommended that deployed ASP.NET applications not be run in debug mode
        resolution: |
            Set the debug attribute of the compilation element to false in the system.web section of the ASP.NET Web.config file.
