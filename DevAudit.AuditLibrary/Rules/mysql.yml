       summary: |
           Utilizing a least privilege account for MySQL to execute as may reduce the impact of a MySQL-born vulnerability. 
           A restricted account will be unable to access resources unrelated to MySQL, such as operating system configurations.
       resolution: |
            Create a user which is only used for running MySQL and directly related processes. This user must not have administrative rights to the system.
            Add a user=mysql key value to the [mysqld] section of your configuration file.

        summary: |
           By default the MySQL server listens on all available addresses and network interfaces. 
           It is more secure to bind the mysql network socket to a single address.		    
           Note that this socket is bound to a single address, but it is possible for an address to map onto multiple network interfaces. 
           
        resolution: |
            Add a directive like the following to the [mysqld] section of your MySQL configuration file: bind-address=127.0.0.1
            which binds MySQL to listen only on the local loopback address.

        summary: |
           In certain cases, the “LOCAL INFILE” MySQL command can be used by database users to gain access to other files on the operating system, for instance “/etc/passwd”. 
           This a known MySQL security hole and should always be plugged by disabling loading files from the filesystem for users without file level privileges to the database.

        summary: |
           The “SHOW DATABASES” MySQL command can be used by potential attackers to gather information about all your databases. 
           Unless it is needed by your application this command should be disabled.

       summary: |
           MySQL can export data using the OUTFILE keyword e.g SELECT * FROM  mysql.db INTO OUTFILE("foo")
           You should always restrict the directories where these export files can be created to avoid sensitive information disclosure
           to potential hackers. 
       resolution: |
            Add a directive like the following to the [mysqld] section of your MySQL configuration file: secure_file_priv=/tmp
            And ensure that this directory has the appropriate security permissions set.

       summary: |
           MySQL can log information about startup and shutdown and critical errors that occur during runtime. These logs can alert you to potential attacks or malicious behaviour by users or apps.
           You should always enable error logging so that this information can be stored for generating alerts and later analysis.
       resolution: |
            Add a directive like the following to the [mysqld] section of your MySQL configuration file:

       summary: |
           It is generally accepted that host operating systems should include different filesystem partitions for different purposes. 
           One set of filesystems are typically called "system partitions", and are generally reserved for host system/application operation. 
           The other set of filesystems are typically called "non-system partitions", and such locations are generally reserved for storing data.
       resolution: |
            Perform the following steps to remediate this setting:
            1. Choose a non system partition new location for the MySQL data
            2. Stop mysqld using a command like: service mysql stop
            3. Copy the data using a command like: cp - rp <datadir Value> <new location>
            4. Set the datadir location to the new location in the MySQL configuration file
            5. Start mysqld using a command like: service mysql star

       summary: |
            On Linux/UNIX, the MySQL client logs statements executed interactively to a history file. 
            By default, this file is named .mysql_history in the user's home directory. 
            Most interactive commands run in the MySQL client application are saved to a history file. 
            The MySQL command history should be disabled.
       resolution: |
            1. Remove .mysql_history if it exists.
            2. Either:
                1. Set the MYSQL_HISTFILE environment variable to /dev/null. This will need to be placed in the shell's startup script.
                2. Create $HOME/.mysql_history as a symbolic to /dev/null.

       summary: |
            MySQL can read a default database password from an environment variable called MYSQL_PWD.
            The use of the MYSQL_PWD environment variable implies the clear text storage of MySQL credentials. 
            Avoiding this may increase assurance that the confidentiality of MySQL credentials is preserved
       resolution: |
            1. Remove .mysql_history if it exists.
