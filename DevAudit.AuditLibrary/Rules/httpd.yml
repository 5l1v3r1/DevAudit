           By default displays the version of your Apache web server installed on your server

           It also shows the information about Apache modules installed in your server.
        resolution: |
            Add the ServerSignature=Off and ServerTokens=Prod directives to the configuration file.

        severity: 2
        xpathtest: /*/Directory[Options/Arg='Indexes']/Arg | /*/Directory[Options/Arg='+Indexes']/Arg
        summary: |
            By default Apache lists the contents of a Document root directory in the absence of index files. 
            Instead you can prevent directory contents from being listed.
        resolution: |
            Add directives like the following to each <Directory /> section.

        summary: |
            Some modules enabled by default are not often needed and can be vectors for security attacks. 
        resolution: |
            Comment out the corresponding LoadModule directives.

        xpathtest: not(boolean(/Httpd/User)) and not(boolean(/Httpd/Group))
        summary: |
            With a default installation Apache runs its process with user nobody or daemon. 
            For security reasons it is recommended to run Apache in its own non-privileged account. For example: http-web. 
        resolution: |
            Add a directive like User http-web to your configuration file.

        xpathtest: not(boolean(/*/Directory/Allow)) or not(boolean(/*/Directory/Deny))
        summary: |
            You should always restrict user access to directories with “Allow” and “Deny” options. 
            By default all users are permitted to access any web-accessible directory.
        resolution: |
            Add directives like the following to your Directory directives:
            Deny from all
            to enable access control for that directory.

            - STIG/V/26325/The TRACE method must be disabled
        xpathtest: not(boolean(/Httpd/*/TraceEnable='Off'))
        summary: |
            The HTTP 1.1 protocol TRACE method writes back the client request as a server response. This method is never needed on production servers and can lead to potential attacks.
        resolution: |
            Add the TraceEnable Off directive to the root level of your Apache configuration file.
            Ensure there are no TraceEnable On directives in any virtual root or directory child sections in your file.
