        xpathtest: not(/SSHD/Values/PermitRootLogin='no')
        summary: |
            By default you can ssh to the server as root. It is best not to allow root to login directly to the server. 
            Instead, you should login to the system as your account and then do ‘su -‘ to login as root.
        resolution: |
            Set PermitRootLogin='yes' in configuration file.

        xpathtest:  not(/SSHD/Values/Protocol='2')
        summary: |
            SSH protocol version 1 (SSH-1) has man-in-the-middle attacks problems and security vulnerabilities. 
            SSH-1 is obsolete and should be avoided at all cost.
        resolution: |
            Add Protocol=2 directive to configuration file.

        xpathtest: not(boolean(/SSHD/Values/AllowUsers)) and not(boolean(/SSHD/Values/AllowGroups)) and not(boolean(/SSHD/Values/DenyUsers)) and not(boolean(/SSHD/Values/DenyGroups))
        summary: |
            By default anybody who is authenticated successfully are allowed to login. 
            Instead you can restrict which users (or groups) you allow to login to the system.
        resolution: |
            Add directives like the following to configuration file: AllowUsers ramesh john jason and AllowGroups remote_workers.

        title:  Port is set to default (Port)
        xpathtest:  /SSHD/Values/Port='22' 
        summary: |
            By default ssh runs on port 22. Most of the attackers will check if a server is open on port 22, 
            and will randomly use brute force to login to the server using several username and password combination.
            If you change the port # to something different, others need to know exactly what port to use to login to the server using ssh.  
        resolution: |
            Add directives like the following to configuration file: Port 773. This will result in ssh listening on port 773.

        title:  User .rhosts files are not disabled (IgnoreRhosts)
        xpathtest:  not(/SSHD/Values/IgnoreRhosts='yes')
        summary: |
            SSH can emulate the behavior of the obsolete rsh command. You should always disable insecure access via RSH.
        resolution: |
            Add IgnoreRhosts=yes directive to configuration file.
