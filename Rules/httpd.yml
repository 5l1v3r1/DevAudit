        summary: |
           When you install Apache with source or any other package installers like yum, it displays the version of your Apache web server installed on your server 
           with the Operating system name of your server in Errors. 
           It also shows the information about Apache modules installed in your server.
        resolution: |
            Add ServerSignature=Off directive to configuration value. 
            Add ServerTokens=Prod directive to configuration file.

        xpathtest: /*/Directory[Options/Arg='Indexes']/Arg | /*/Directory[Options/Arg='+Indexes']/Arg
        summary: |
            By default Apache lists the contents of a Document root directory in the absence of index files. 
            Instead you can prevent directory contents from being listed.
        resolution: |
            Add directives like the following to each <Directory /> section.

            /*/LoadModule/Arg[contains(text(), 'mod_autoindex')]
        summary: |
            Some modules enabled by default are not often needed and can be vectors for security attacks. 
        resolution: |
            Comment out the corresponding LoadModule directives.

        title:  Run Apache as separate user and group (User Group)
        xpathtest: not(boolean(/Httpd/User)) or not(boolean(/Httpd/Group))
        summary: |
            With a default installation Apache runs its process with user nobody or daemon. 
            For security reasons it is recommended to run Apache in its own non-privileged account. For example: http-web. 
        resolution: |
            Add a directive like User http-web to your configuration file.
