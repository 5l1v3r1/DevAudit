        summary: |
           By default the name and versions of the application frameworks an ASP.NET application uses are sent as response headers, like X-AspNetMvc-Version. 
           For maximum safety it is recommended that these headers not be enabled.
        resolution: |
            Add the attribute enableVersionHeader=false to the httpRuntime element of the system.web section of the ASP.NET Web.config file.

           is disclosed by ASP.NET to visitors when a runtime error is encountered.
           This information should bever be disclosed in an application that is deployed.
