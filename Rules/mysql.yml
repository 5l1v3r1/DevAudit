        summary: |
           mysqld can (and should) be run as an ordinary, unprivileged user instead. 
           You can create a separate Unix account named mysql to make everything even more secure. Use this account only for administering MySQL.           
        resolution: |
            Create an ordinary, unnprivileged user account called mysql (or a name of your choice.)
            Add a user=mysql key value to the [mysqld] section of your configuration file.

        title:  mysqld accepts TCP/IP connections on all IPv6 and IPv4 interfaces
        xpathtest: not(boolean(/MySQL/mysqld/bind_address))
        summary: |
           By default the MySQL server listens on all available addresses and network interfaces. 
           It is more secure to bind the mysql network socket to a single address.		    
           Note that this socket is bound to a single address, but it is possible for an address to map onto multiple network interfaces.

            Create an ordinary, unnprivileged user account called mysql (or a name of your choice.)
            Add a user=mysql key value to the [mysqld] section of your configuration file.
